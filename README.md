# Jack's Py Games
a collection of popular games written in Python

Each of these games features an AI that operates off of algorithms for the player to play against

all games will work right away with the lastest version of python, with the exception of connect 4. For connect 4 to work, you must install colorama.

to install colorama run the colorama-quickinstall.py file, run `pip install colorama` in command-line, or use another dependency management method of your choice

I do not own the rights to these games, I have just provided a way to play them in a console/terminal
